    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Web_Name_READONLY__c}

Thank you for contacting {!Case.Brand__c} Customer Service.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our warehouse is taking additional precautions to ensure all necessary safety measures are being taken. As a result, order processing may be delayed. If you paid with a credit card, a pre-authorization hold was placed on the card for the amount of the order. The charge will not post until the order has shipped.

Additionally, we are experiencing extended customer service response times. We are working hard to provide answers to your questions while caring for the health and safety of our associates. We appreciate your patience at this time.

Should you need any further assistance, please do not hesitate to respond to this message.

Kind Regards,
{!Case.Brand__c} Customer Service
